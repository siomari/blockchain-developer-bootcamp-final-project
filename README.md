ConsenSys Academy Final Project 2021

## NFTulips

A dapp that aims to give value to content created by 'influencers' on social media. The creators will have the opportunity to sell their instagram pictures as NFTs.

By using chainlink the dapp will be able to access real wolrd data from a social media platform e.g.Instagram. The content produced by the user using our dapp, could be sold as an NFT. 

NFT creation and mining will be dependent to the virality of the post. In particular, the numbers of the NFT available will decrease depending on the likes that the post have received over some predefined periods of time or reaction ammount.
